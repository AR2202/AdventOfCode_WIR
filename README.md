# Women in Rust - Advent of Code 2024 üéÑü¶Ä

Welcome to the Women in Rust Advent of Code 2024 repository! Here you'll find Rust project templates for each day of the Advent of Code challenge.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. Each day from December 1st through December 24th, a new puzzle is released at midnight EST. These puzzles range in difficulty and can be used for:
- Interview preparation
- Learning a new programming language
- University coursework
- Practice problems
- Friendly competition

We are going to use this brilliant and festive opportunity to learn and practice Rust together. 

## Repository Structure

This repository contains 24 Rust projects, one for each day of Advent:
```
advent_of_code_2024/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day_01/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day_02/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ day_03/
...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ day_24/
```

Each project is a basic Cargo project with no external dependencies.
